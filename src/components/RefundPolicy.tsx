        1. Digital Products & Courses
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        All our offerings — including online courses, digital resources, recorded
        sessions, downloadable content and any other virtual products — are
        considered <strong>digital goods</strong>. Once the payment is successful and
        access is granted to the content, the purchase is <strong>final and
        non-refundable</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-600">
        2. No Change of Mind / No Returns
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We do <strong>not</strong> accept requests for returns, replacements, or refunds
        for reasons such as:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>“I don’t need it anymore.”</li>
        <li>“I bought it by mistake.”</li>
        <li>“I expected something else.”</li>
        <li>“I finished the course and want a refund.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Please review the course / program details carefully before making the
        payment.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-600">
        3. Payment Success but No Access?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If your money was deducted but you <strong>didn’t receive access</strong> because of
        a technical / payment gateway / browser issue, please contact us within
        <strong> 48 hours</strong> with the transaction details. In such genuine cases, we
        will either:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>provide / restore access to the course you purchased, or</li>
        <li>
          in rare cases where access cannot be provided, process a refund to the
          original payment method.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        These are <strong>exception-based</strong> actions — not a general refund policy.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-600">
        4. Duplicate / Failed Transactions
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you are charged more than once for the same order, or there is a clear
        duplicate payment on our system, we will verify it in our payment records
        and issue a refund for the extra amount only.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-600">
        5. Courses Bought via Offers / Discounts
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Purchases made under <strong>special offers, coupons, festive discounts,
        limited-time deals, or bundle pricing</strong> are also strictly non-refundable.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-600">
        6. Service Interruptions
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We try to keep the platform live and available at all times. Temporary
        downtime due to maintenance, hosting issues, or third-party service
        outages does <strong>not</strong> qualify for a refund.
      </p>
