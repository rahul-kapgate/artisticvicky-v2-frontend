      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-purple-700">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) governs how <strong>Artistic Vickey</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects,
        uses, maintains and discloses information from users (“you”, “your”) of our website and related services
        (collectively, the “Platform”). By accessing or using our Platform, providing your Personal Information,
        or otherwise indicating your consent, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with
        this Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use our Platform.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-600">1. Personal Information</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        “Personal Information” means information that identifies you — such as your name, email address, phone
        number, location, or other identifier you provide. “Sensitive Personal Information” includes account
        credentials, financial information, biometric data, or other special categories of data under applicable
        laws.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-600">2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We may collect both personal and non-personal information in various ways, including when you visit our
        Platform, register, make a purchase, subscribe to our newsletter, or otherwise interact. For example:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Personal Identifiable Information: your name, email address, phone number, and any other information you provide.</li>
        <li>Non-Personal Identifiable Information: browser type, referring site, date/time of visits, operating system, and other analytics data.</li>
        <li>Cookies and similar technologies: to enable website functionality and improve UX. You may refuse cookies via your browser settings — though certain parts of the Platform may not work properly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-600">3. How We Use and Share the Information</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">

        <li>Providing access to our Platform, fulfilling orders, responding to queries, and delivering customer support.</li>
        <li>Improving and maintaining our Platform, safeguarding it from fraud or abuse.</li>
        <li>Communicating with you about products, services, updates, marketing offers — where you’ve opted in.</li>
        <li>Sharing aggregated anonymised data (that cannot identify you) with business partners, affiliates, or third-party service providers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We do **not** sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal-identifiable information to outside parties, except as described in this Policy or as required by law.

        <li>You may opt-out of marketing communications at any time by contacting us or following the unsubscribe mechanism in our messages.</li>
        <li>You can disable or delete cookies via browser settings — noting some features may then cease to function correctly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-600">5. Your Rights</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-600">6. Protection of Your Information</h2>

        We take reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect your information against unauthorised
        access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. We limit access to your information to those employees,
        contractors and agents who need it for the purposes described in this Policy, and they are obligated to
        keep it confidential.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-600">7. Third-Party Websites</h2>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-600">8. Cross-Border Data Transfer</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Your information may be stored or processed in India or any other country where our service providers
        operate. By using our Platform, you consent to transfers of your data across jurisdictions, including
        where the privacy laws may be different from those in your country of residence.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-600">9. Retention Period</h2>

        of information may be archived or anonymised when no longer required.
      </p>
